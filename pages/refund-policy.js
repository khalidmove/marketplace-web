                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal md:pb-5 pb-2'>Resaz prioritizes user satisfaction above all else. Should you encounter any issues with your order, we
                    encourage you to reach out to us via our live chat, hotline number, or email, and we will provide the
                    necessary assistance. In suitable circumstances, if you have already been charged by Resaz, we are
                    prepared to offer either a full or partial refund or replace. Specifically, a full refund may be granted if
                    your order was not received or if an incorrect order was delivered. Conversely, if only a portion of your
                    order is missing, a partial refund may be applicable. In all situations, we are committed to doing our
                    utmost to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal md:pb-5 pb-2'>Once the customer has received their order, in case there is any issue such as: expired/ wrong/ missing/
                    ... items, they can ask for an exchange or refund.</p>
                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal md:pb-5 pb-2'>All they have to do is to submit their Exchange/ Refund request by sending us an Email on <a href="mailto:help@resazonline.com" className='font-bold'>help@resazonline.com</a> including "the invoice, a photo and a detailed explanation of the problem they
                    have with the product".</p>
                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal md:pb-5 pb-2'>Our customer support team will take care of the request letter and will notify the customer as soon as
                    possible once the request is approved.</p>
                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal md:pb-5 pb-2'>In case the request of Exchange/ Return has been approved by our team we will follow up with the
                    request to either refund or replace the product based on the customerâ€™s choice.</p>
                <p className='text-base	text-black font-normal'>Note: The Exchange/ Return request is available for maximum one day after the order has been delivered.</p>
